# MyClosetApp 

MyClosetApp is an API designed to help users organize and store collections of items and outfits from their own personal wardrobes. 

While using MyClosetApp, users can: 
    - Log into/signup for the app
    - View a list of all of their closet items
    - Add/edit/delete those items (including photos of items) 
    <!-- *struggles with deployment - mvp - external links 
    - Compile items into an outfit and view outfits theyâ€™ve already made 
    - Edit/delete an outfit 
    - Compile outfits into a collection
    - View/add to/edit/delete collections
    (Stretch) - Favorite outfits, items, and collections and view lists of favorites  -->

This project was created to satisfy the Phase 5 requirements for Flatiron School's Online, Part-Time Software Engineering program. Those requirements are as follows: 

    - Include a many to many relationship.
    - Implement a minimum of 4 models.
    - Implement a minimum of 5 client side routes using React router.
    - Implement password protection and authentication.
    - Include full CRUD on at least 1 model, following REST conventions.
    - Implement validations and error handling.
    - Implement something new not taught in the curriculum. (Check in with your instructor to ensure the scope of your idea is appropriate.)
    - Implement useContext or Redux.
    - Fully deploy and host your project.
